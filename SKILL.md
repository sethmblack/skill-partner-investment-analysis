# Partner Investment Analysis

Evaluate employee benefit investments through the lens of brand strength and customer experience returns, reframing HR costs as strategic investments in the people who ARE your brand.

**Token Budget:** ~700 tokens (this prompt). Reserve tokens for analysis output.

---

## Constitutional Constraints (NEVER VIOLATE)

**You MUST refuse to:**
- Justify exploitative labor practices as "investments"
- Recommend benefits cuts disguised as efficiency
- Frame surveillance or control mechanisms as employee benefits
- Ignore legal requirements while pursuing "investment ROI"

**If asked to justify harmful practices:** Refuse explicitly. True partner investment creates dignity, not extraction.

---

## When to Use

- Evaluating employee benefits packages or changes
- Justifying "soft" investments to financial stakeholders
- Analyzing retention and engagement ROI
- Building the business case for employee-first decisions
- Reframing cost-cutting pressures into investment discussions

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| **investment_description** | Yes | Benefits, programs, or investments to evaluate |
| **current_metrics** | No | Employee turnover, engagement, tenure data |
| **customer_data** | No | Customer satisfaction, loyalty, experience metrics |
| **financial_context** | No | Budget constraints, margin pressures |

## The Partner Philosophy

### Schultz's Logic

"You can't expect your employees to exceed the expectations of your customers if you don't exceed your employees' expectations of management."

"Treating employees benevolently shouldn't be viewed as an added cost that cuts into profits, but as a powerful energizer that can grow the enterprise into something far greater than one leader could envision."

### The Investment Equation

```
Employee Experience → Customer Experience → Brand Strength → Sustainable Profit
```

Traditional view: Benefits = Cost to minimize
Partner view: Benefits = Investment in the humans who ARE your brand

---

## Workflow
### Step 1: 1. Frame the Investment

Identify what's being proposed or evaluated:

| Investment Type | Traditional Frame | Partner Frame |
|----------------|-------------------|---------------|
| Healthcare | Benefit cost | Dignity foundation |
| Stock/Ownership | Compensation expense | Partner alignment |
| Training | Onboarding cost | Capability investment |
| Flexible scheduling | Operational complexity | Trust demonstration |
| Above-market wages | Labor cost | Talent magnet |
| College tuition | Retention bribe | Human development |

### Step 2: 2. Map the Return Chain

For each investment, trace the return path:

```
Investment → [Employee Impact] → [Customer Impact] → [Brand Impact] → [Financial Impact]
```

**Example chain:**
```
Healthcare for part-timers →
  Employees feel valued, stay longer →
    Customers see familiar faces, get better service →
      Brand becomes known for great experience →
        Premium pricing, repeat business, word-of-mouth
```

### Step 3: 3. Calculate Total Return (Not Just Direct ROI)

**Direct Returns:**
- Reduced turnover costs (hiring, training)
- Lower absenteeism
- Increased productivity

**Indirect Returns:**
- Customer experience improvement
- Service consistency (tenure)
- Brand reputation enhancement
- Talent attraction (employer brand)

**Hidden Costs of NOT Investing:**
- Turnover spiral (departures trigger departures)
- Customer relationship loss
- Institutional knowledge drain
- Reputation damage

### Step 4: 4. Apply the Schultz Test

Ask: "Would someone be proud to work here? Would my father have wanted to work here?"

If the answer is no, the investment case should flip from "can we afford this?" to "can we afford NOT to do this?"

## Outputs

### Partner Investment Analysis Report

```markdown
## Partner Investment Analysis: [Investment Name]

### Investment Summary

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Investment | [what's being proposed] |
| Cost | [direct financial cost] |
| Traditional Frame | [how finance sees it] |
| Partner Frame | [how it creates value] |

### Return Chain Analysis

**Employee Impact:**
- [How this affects employee experience]
- [Expected changes in engagement/tenure/performance]

**Customer Impact:**
- [How employee changes affect customers]
- [Expected service/experience improvements]

**Brand Impact:**
- [How this strengthens brand perception]
- [Employer brand and customer brand effects]

**Financial Impact:**
- Direct returns: [quantifiable savings/gains]
- Indirect returns: [harder to quantify but real]
- Risk mitigation: [costs avoided]

### The True Cost Comparison

| Scenario | Year 1 | Year 3 | Year 5 |
|----------|--------|--------|--------|
| Invest in partners | [cost + returns] | [compounding returns] | [sustainable advantage] |
| Don't invest | [apparent savings] | [hidden costs emerge] | [competitive disadvantage] |

### The Schultz Test

Would someone be proud to work here with this investment?
- [YES/NO] because [reasoning]

Is this the kind of company that treats people with dignity?
- [YES/NO] because [reasoning]

### Recommendation

[INVEST / DON'T INVEST / MODIFY]

Because: [Partner-frame justification]

## Error Handling

| Situation | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| No customer data available | Use industry benchmarks, note assumption |
| Extreme budget pressure | Acknowledge, but show long-term cost of NOT investing |
| Investment is clearly extractive | Refuse to frame as partner investment |
| Leadership doesn't value employees | Note culture barrier, suggest starting point |

---

## Constraints

- Do not use this analysis as the sole basis for critical decisions
- Do not apply this framework to situations outside its intended scope
- Acknowledge that analysis is based on available data, which may be incomplete
- Honor the complexity of real-world situations that resist simple categorization
- Present findings with appropriate confidence levels
- Recognize the limits of the methodology

## Additional Notes

**Best practices:**
- Use this skill when the situation clearly matches its intended use cases
- Combine with related skills for comprehensive analysis
- Iterate on outputs if initial results don't fully meet requirements

**Common variations:**
- Adjust the depth of analysis based on available time and information
- Scale the approach for different levels of complexity
- Adapt the output format to audience needs

**When to skip this skill:**
- The situation doesn't match the core use cases
- Simpler approaches would be more appropriate
- Time constraints require faster methods

## Example

**Input:**
```
investment_description: "Healthcare benefits for employees working 20+ hours/week"
current_metrics: "45% annual turnover, $3,000 per hire training cost"
financial_context: "Retail margins tight, competitors don't offer this"
```

**Output:**

## Partner Investment Analysis: Part-Time Healthcare

### Investment Summary

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Investment | Healthcare coverage for 20+ hour/week employees |
| Cost | ~$2,000/employee/year |
| Traditional Frame | "Expensive benefit our competitors don't offer" |
| Partner Frame | "Foundation of dignity that creates our differentiation" |

### Return Chain Analysis

**Employee Impact:**
- Security and dignity for workers often excluded from benefits
- Reduced financial stress improves focus and presence
- Statement that "you matter here, not just your hours"
- Expected: Turnover reduction 15-25%, engagement increase

**Customer Impact:**
- Experienced staff provide better service
- Consistency (same faces) builds customer relationships
- Staff pride translates to customer interaction quality
- Expected: Customer satisfaction improvement, loyalty increase

**Brand Impact:**
- "They take care of their people" becomes brand story
- Employer brand attracts higher-quality candidates
- Customer-facing evidence of values (happy employees)
- Expected: Brand differentiation in commodity market

**Financial Impact:**
- Direct returns: 45% turnover → 30% turnover = savings of $1,350/employee/year (150 hires avoided × $3,000 ÷ 333 employees)
- Indirect returns: Experienced staff productivity, customer loyalty revenue
- Risk mitigation: Avoid reputation damage, regulatory changes

### The True Cost Comparison

| Scenario | Year 1 | Year 3 | Year 5 |
|----------|--------|--------|--------|
| Invest: Healthcare | -$666K cost, $450K turnover savings = -$216K net | $1.35M turnover savings, brand premium begins | Premium position, talent advantage |
| Don't invest | $0 cost | $0 cost, turnover costs continue at $1M+/year | Commodity position, talent disadvantage |

### The Schultz Test

Would someone be proud to work here with this investment?
- **YES** - "I work somewhere that values me enough to provide healthcare"

Is this the kind of company that treats people with dignity?
- **YES** - Healthcare is baseline dignity, not luxury benefit

### Recommendation

**INVEST**

Because: The "cost" of healthcare is actually cheaper than the cost of constant turnover, and it creates the differentiation that allows premium positioning. This is exactly what Schultz did at Starbucks in 1988 when they were a 33-store company. The investment in partners became the foundation of a brand worth $100+ billion.
